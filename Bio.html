<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Matt Childrey is a senior undergraduate student at the University of Memphis, finishing a BA with majors in both English &amp; Philosophy. <br> &nbsp;He will graduate Magna Cum Laude in the Spring of 2020, as a member of the Helen Hardin Honors College, and as a steady volunteer with <br> the University of Memphis&rsquo; Center for International Education Services. He started working with them after he studied at the University of Kent&rsquo;s <br> nationally ranked philosophy department in Canterbury, England as an exchange student for a semester. Whether it is advising local students leaving <br> for Europe, helping welcome international students arriving in Memphis, or simple preparational duties needed by the Study Abroad department, <br> he enjoys his time working at the intersection of travel and academia. Upon graduation, Matt will start his postgraduate career in law during the <br> Fall of 2020, and he is currently fielding offers from several universities. In his free time, Matt enjoys computers and technology, and it is <br> that cross of STEM-esque hobbies with an academic career in the liberal arts that he wishes to pursue during law school. While he enjoys practicing <br> coding and building computers, the type skills that lend him to be an excellent coworker for support, it&rsquo;s his time playing, writing, watching <br> and supporting the esports market that has persuaded him towards law. From a kid competing in amateur online tournaments, to a young-adult writing <br> detailed guides and breakdowns of competitive events, he has an obvious vested interest in the space. That interest has made him aware of the troubles young <br> players and growing teams face when crafting contracts with each other, often without legal representation. From the unequal brand deals reported on in THR, <br> to the lack of housing amenities leaked on online forums, Matt has been avidly aware of the issues these millennials face and hopes his career in law can be <br> centered around helping them. This career isn&rsquo;t a far off task though, as he has already started committing his time towards it with pieces about legal issues <br> in esports on his personal website, and volunteering to help moderate a popular weekly esports talk show.</p>
