<h2> Issue Memo and Engagement Guide </h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Unit 3 was the fastest of all, as we had just a few weeks to complete both the Minor and Major assignments. While the work of the Minor assignment was directly linked to that of the Major, (unlike Unit 2 were they sort of stand apart independently) it was still a great struggle to keep up with the pace. One reason could have been because I chose to complete the engagement guide by myself, instead of working with a partner. This was for two reasons, one being that I emailed the people that I knew in the class, those that had work ethics I could trust, a bit too late. I had honestly become so accustomed to waiting until the weekend to work on our class&rsquo; material, that it was a shock when I saw the minor assignment was due that Sunday we were assigned it. The established peers had already chosen partners, and the unknowns from the class list that I emailed didn&rsquo;t respond. So, I started and completed the Unit myself, which was honestly a gamble. But, I&rsquo;m glad I did, because I felt like I had a much easier time completing the work. Whether that be due to the ease of scheduling with just yourself, or from conceptualizing and agreeing upon ideas inside of just one mind, I don&rsquo;t know for sure. But I do know it&rsquo;s how I work best, and that I&rsquo;m lucky you didn&rsquo;t discredit my work for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minor assignment was a short, 2-page memo that introduced the reader to the issue we would be covering with the Major assignment&rsquo;s engagement guide. I immediately knew I wanted to do something with tech, and a recent problem I had just faced with elderly family friends lead me to write about online safety for our local community. As a tech guy, who is always studying liberal arts, I&rsquo;m really invested in those neat intersections in which two seemingly opposing communities or markets meetup. The idea of a digital campaign, focused on this growing problem of Phishing attacks and Robocalls, but narrowed down and tailored towards local marketability, was a no-brainer for me. I researched stories through our local news stations, like WMCTV and WREG first. After that, I relied on more national points of information, like the Post and more. Yet, I felt like those caused the memo to sound to disconnected from Memphis, so I cut them down and added more information from local district court cases instead. For the memo, it really helped that some of the information I already knew, such as the recent legal events in the Western District, and what some of the jargon being used meant (such as call spoofing and MMS phishing), but much of the memo style I had to work on. Characteristics like typography choice, brevity, and the document&rsquo;s style were not so easy to decide on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Unit 3&rsquo;s Major assignment, or the #901Locked Engagement guide itself, I split it into three sections. First, there was the research material I needed to compile. Other than the local news clippings I already had, I needed sources for statistical information about online attacks and recommendations on combating them. This originally seemed like an odd step to me, because it felt as though I was sourcing a comment about how to start a car. Tricks like 2FA and password managers have been in my toolbox for years now, but after reading about the correlations between age and tech illiteracy, I knew it was important to many still. Second, I started to outline what the visuals would look like. I choose to keep a simple black and white theme, because I had already been using color throughout the semester so far (blue in the design glossary, purple in the Olympics analysis, red and yellow in the City Year guide) and I was testing out simple shape tools as decorations, which worked best in just black. Finally, I gathered the text into a single word document, much like a final essay, so that after a night&rsquo;s sleep I was able to wake and craft the InDesign document in one sitting.</p>
