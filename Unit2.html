<h2>Brand Analysis and Branding Quick Guide </h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unit 2 occurred during the middle of the semester, and it swallowed up the entirety of our schedule in October. Unlike Unit 1, which required students to study the reading in our assigned textbooks, this section of the course was taught more through unique and different types of material like case studies and tutorial videos. The former wasn&rsquo;t too unusual, especially when in regard to my future career path of law, and I really enjoyed our discussion about the West Sixth vs. Magic Hat case. Yet, it was still a different starting format than what I had come to expect for designing documents after Unit 1. The tutorial videos though were something I had never experienced in a class before. For some, using videos as a tutorial to learn a new skill seems silly, whether it be in the context of a college course or not. Yet, as a millennial, and especially as a technologically oriented teenage boy without much guidance, I&rsquo;ve historically relied on guides just like the ones we watched. To transition from using them to learn how to install a graphics card into my computer, or how to cook an omelet, into how to operate Adobe Illustrator for a class was comfortable. Despite the fact that I sadly lack any artistic ability and my group deepened on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Minor Assignment 2 asked us to choose a case study from a list and analyze it much as we did in Minor Assignment 1. Except, this time, the analysis was more focused on the new branding principles we had learned. Instead of looking at specific pieces, we studied the brands as a whole and commented on characteristics like their ethos, public reception, or historicalness. I choose to research the 2012 London Summer Olympics, not only because it was such a heavyweight in terms of recognition, but also merely because around that time of autumn last year I had been in London myself. I thought studying the branding material would be neat, as it would connect back to the city as a fun reminder. I was wrong. And I noticed my incorrectness pretty fast, as it was a huge piece of the analyzation and popular criticism spewed at the Olympic brand. The extra experience I had under my belt when creating this assignment&rsquo;s PDF, combined with the more fun research (seriously, how did the committee think that logo was good), led this to personally be my favorite assignment I created in the class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Minor Assignment was finished, we were automatically placed into groups to start Major Assignment 2. At first, it was just Esuria and I, as we picked out the education-focused charity City Year to redesign. They were a perfect middle ground, a local charity that has an impact in Memphis, but also has branches throughout the United States to use for research purposes. While gathering information about their brand, Sarah joined our group. There was some difficulty in our email threads re-dividing the work from halves into thirds, but we survived in the end. I created a new logo in Illustrator, by using Sarah&rsquo;s hand-drawn sketches as feedback. Esuria helped compile the research and draft our memos, and I formatted the document myself InDesign. After copyediting it until minutes before the deadline, we turned it in, and although I had multiple hands, plenty of time, and even received a decent grade,&nbsp; I still think of it to be the hardest assignment in the class.</p>
