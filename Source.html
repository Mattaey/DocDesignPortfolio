<h2>Portfolio Website Source Code</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since we were given the opportunity to choose which medium we wanted to present our portfolio in, I chose a website. Yet, a bit more complicated version than just writing a WordPress blog or using SquareSpace. In my free time, I upload small essays on politics, law, poetry, and anything else I'm interested in really, to my website that I write and host myself. I've always been interested in learning to code, and although I don't know complex languages like Python or Ruby, I'm pretty happy with how far I've come with HTML now! It's simple, but it's still an effective and fun tool to have in my back pocket as a writer. I'm using my Github repository that I normally use to host my website's own, so as long as this site is up for the final, my own website is down. It's okay though, I forwarded mattaey.com to an extremely sophisticated service page (a picture of a cat that says website is down).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is the source code in a PDF, that way if you're interested you can see the design work. You can also check out the repository with all of the files yourself at <a href="https://github.com/Mattaey/mattaey.github.io/">github.com/Mattaey/mattaey.github.io/</a>&nbsp;I know it's not as flashy as something possible in InDesign, with shapes, colors, typography changes and such. But I think the accessibility of the portfolio, and the innovation are worth noting. Have a good holiday!</p>
