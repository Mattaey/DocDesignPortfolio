<h2>Visual Analysis Essay and Design Glossary</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unit 1 ran from the beginning of the class in August, until the middle of September. During those initial four weeks, we started to read and study our textbooks, as well as other supplemental material uploaded on ecourseware. From Heskett to Lupton, and then Kimball and Hawkins, our focus was to simply start recognizing what we believe design to be at that moment, a time before we had any work done in the class. By leaving us without a prior definition, it was oddly extremely helpful in understanding the true goals and values design as a subject has. This is because, despite being a student of thinkers like Chaucer and Kant, every human in a capitalistic world has some experience with design. It&rsquo;s absolutely everywhere, and when we understand that, and what that means for its values and goals, it makes learning all of the definitions and introductory work much easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minor Assignment 1, or the Visual Analysis Essay, was a short essay that required us to articulate our definition of design, pick out and explicate a piece of design, as well as practice our growing understandings of key design principles. I choose Rolex&rsquo;s (the famous Swiss watchmaker) website homepage. My initial reasonings were fairly simple; for one, they make extremely elegant watches so it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bore to look at for quite some time, and second, as such an artistically faithful company, they must have a website that is heavily influenced by these principles I had been studying. I pointed out navigation bars, multimedia windows, and interactive murals, along with dropping newly learned terms such as contrast, proximity, and typography. Despite managing to write an essay I felt faithful to, I failed to focus on the visual correlation between the website and the analysis. Without providing key pictures or screenshots, the essay is sort of like explaining snow to a Floridian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Assignment 1, or the Design Glossary, was an interesting assignment. It was very straightforward in its task, to define 5 major design principles, yet, it was simultaneously difficult as it was the first assignment that asked us to create a document using Adobe InDesign. I thought it would be easy to learn, since I had taught myself editing programs in high school, such as Premiere and Final Cut, and I was familiar with some Adobe programs like Lightroom and Aftereffects. I was sadly wrong. Despite the brevity of the task, it took me quite some time to learn the controls. In the end, though, I was pleased with my product. I actually had quite a fun time looking up old Classic Rock billboards around Hollywood Boulevard and the Sunset strip, to use as representations of Contrast, Kerning, and Spacing.</p>
